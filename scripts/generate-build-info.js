// Writes public/build.json with the current build's timestamp and (when
// running in GitHub Actions) the commit it was built from. Run via
// `npm run build` — normally only in CI. Locally, simply not running this
// leaves public/build.json absent, and the page's "Built ... ago" footer
// just stays empty in that case (see loadBuildInfo() in index.html) rather
// than erroring — a real build.json is only expected on the deployed site.
//
// GitHub Actions sets these env vars automatically for every workflow run:
// https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables
